	<h1>My profile</h1>
	<div class="introduction">
		From my experience as a software developer, solutions architect and designer on e-commerce platforms, internal tools, documentation, customer spaces, I collaborate with product teams, tech and all stakeholders to design end-to-end experiences.
	</div>
	<div class="introduction">
		I help discover new needs and problems by being in contact with product users, and find solutions that are simple to design, easy for the developers to develop, use and maintain.
	</div>
	<div class="introduction">
		My skills cover user solution prototyping, technical specification, budgeting, coordination between teams, documentation, deployment, maintenance, performance/usability follow-up and fine tuning.
	</div>
	<div class="introduction">
		Pragmatic, I think "macro" and think through product and strategic issues.
	</div>

	<h1>My experience</h1>
	<div class="introduction">
		Since very early age, I had the opportunity to learn programming, along with graphic design self-learning through assisting to my father's own graphic design company.
	</div>
	<div class="introduction">
		After my university degree, I had the opportunity to shortly move to Paris, then Nice to work in a francophone environment, and excel in my domain.
	</div>
	<div class="introduction">
		In parallel of my professional experience, in 2021 I translated <a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi">The Gender Dysphoria Bible in both Hungarian and French</a>, with that I discovered my urge and willingness to assist on such projects. This is when I also started hosting my own podcast, the <a href="https://1tpc.hu">Egy Transz Podcast</a>, sharing my own experience mixing with collected resources.
	</div>
	<div class="introduction">
		In 2023, I launched the website <a href="https://genderutikalauz.hu">Gender Ãštikalauz</a>, a wiki-like information website. This also opened opportunities to collaborate with different Hungary-based supporting communities and associations.
